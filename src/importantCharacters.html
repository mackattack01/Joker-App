					</tr>
					<tr>
					  <td>Harley Quinn (Dr. Harleen Quinzel)</td>
					  <td>Initially introduced as the Joker's psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum, Harley Quinn becomes his loyal accomplice and lover.

							The Joker has targeted Gordon and his family multiple times to torment Batman and demonstrate his power over Gotham.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>

						<td>The Joker's attack on Barbara Gordon, where he paralyzes her in "The Killing Joke,"

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Jason Todd (Robin/Red Hood)</td>
						<td>The Joker's brutal murder of Jason Todd, the second Robin, in "A Death in the Family," 
							is one of Batman's greatest failures and profoundly impacts the Bat-family.
