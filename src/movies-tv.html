					  <td>"Batman" (1989) directed by Tim Burton, features Jack Nicholson's iconic portrayal of the Joker,
						  a criminal mastermind in Gotham City. The film follows the emergence of Batman,
						  portrayed by Michael Keaton, as he battles against the Joker's reign of terror.
						  The Joker, originally Jack Napier, is transformed into his villainous persona after a confrontation with Batman, 
						  leaving him disfigured and vengeful. With Gotham's fate hanging in the balance, 
						  Batman must confront the Joker's chaotic schemes while navigating his own identity and relationships,

					  <td>"The Dark Knight" (2008), directed by Christopher Nolan, stars Heath Ledger in his iconic role as the Joker.
						  The film follows Batman, played by Christian Bale, as he faces his greatest challenge yet in the form of the Joker,
						  a psychopathic criminal mastermind wreaking havoc on Gotham City. Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is hauntingly brilliant,
						  as he orchestrates chaos and destruction with no discernible motive other than to prove that anyone can be pushed to their breaking point. 
						  The Joker's relentless pursuit of anarchy forces Batman to confront his own moral code and the limits of his crusade for justice. 
						  As the city descends into chaos, Batman must grapple with difficult choices while facing off against the Joker in a battle of wills that will determine the fate of Gotham.</td>

						<td>Joker</td>
						<td>2019</td>
						<td>"Joker" (2019), directed by Todd Phillips, stars Joaquin Phoenix in a gripping portrayal of the iconic Batman villain. 
							The film delves into the origins of Arthur Fleck, a mentally troubled aspiring comedian whose descent into madness leads him to adopt the persona of the Joker. 
							Set against the backdrop of a gritty and decaying Gotham City, Arthur's struggles with mental illness, societal rejection, and personal tragedy gradually transform him into the emblem of chaos and anarchy. 
							Phoenix's mesmerizing performance captures the character's complexity, portraying Arthur's journey from a marginalized and misunderstood figure to a symbol of rebellion and nihilism. 
							As Arthur embraces his alter ego, the Joker, he ignites a wave of unrest and violence that reverberates throughout the city, 
							ultimately culminating in a confrontation with Batman's future alter ego. "Joker" offers a chilling exploration of the human psyche and the societal forces that can drive a person to madness.</td>
